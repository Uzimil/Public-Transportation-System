# Public-Transportation-System
The Public Transportation System (PTS) project aims to address inefficiencies in terminal-based public transportation by providing real-time updates and accurate information. The goal is to enhance the travel experience, increase passenger satisfaction, and promote public transport use by making it more reliable and user-friendly. The system includes features like real-time updates, estimated arrival times, fare details, and route planning, improving decision-making for passengers. An administrative interface with secure login and role-based access is also included for managing system settings.

This focuses on developing a user-friendly interface and efficient administrative tools for selected terminals (e.g., Gingoog, Claveria, Agora, Balingasag, Balingoan, Salay). Features include vehicle availability, departure schedules, driver and vehicle details, and route planning. Delimitations exclude real-time vehicle tracking, traffic management, and broader transport network optimization.
